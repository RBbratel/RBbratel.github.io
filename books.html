	<h2>My favorite Books</h2>

	<p>My all time favorite books are the hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I first read the Hobbit
at a young age and was one of the fastest books I have read. The story captivated me from the start. However, I 
did not enjoy the movie trilogy of this book. After reading this book it was almost necessary to continue 
the story in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The reading of the entire trilogy took a very long time but was totally
worth the time. I read these books after watching the movies which made it more enjoyable since it was easier
to mentally progress the story.</p>
