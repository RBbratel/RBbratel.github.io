	<h2>My favorite moves</h2>

	<p>One of my all time favorite movies is Napoleon Dynamite. I first watched this movie as a chiid
and still to this day regard it as one of if not my favorite movie. The simplicity of the plot that is 
strife with interesting characters and themes makes it hooking every time I watch.</p>
	<p>Another favorite of mine is the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Again, these are movies that I have grown
up watching and no matter how many times I watch them, it still captivates me. The journey throughout the films
is like no other and if I watch one movie, I always seem to end up watching the rest of them.</p>
